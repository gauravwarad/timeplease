1. Core Tracking Engines

The app operates in two distinct modes. Every session is "mapped" to a Project.

    Pomodoro Mode: * Traditional Focus/Short Break/Long Break cycles.

        Configurable durations (Default: 25/5/15 mins).

        Automatic cycle counting (e.g., Long Break after 4 sessions).

    Free Flow Mode: * Standard stopwatch functionality (Count-up).

        Manual stop when the task is finished.

    The "Honesty Check" (Post-Session):

        Upon ending any session, a mandatory prompt asks: "How many minutes did you actually work?"

        Defaults to the full elapsed time, but allows manual override.

        optional Includes a Session Label field "what did you work on so that you can look back on it later" (e.g., "Refactoring login logic").

2. Project Management (The Context)

A "Project" is a simple bucket for organizing sessions. This is strictly for categorization, not task management.

    Project CRUD:

        Create: Name, Color Code, and a dedicated Notes field (Markdown-lite or plain text).

        Read: List of active projects.

        Update: Edit name, notes, or color.

        Delete/Archive: Archive projects to hide them from the active timer list while preserving their historical data in metrics.

3. The Minimalist HUD (The Visualizer)
A "Visibility over Velocity" feature to keep the user focused.

    Always-on-Top Clock: A tiny, floating window displaying current session time.

    Draggable UI: Can be moved anywhere on the screen.

    Toggleable: Can be completely disabled via settings.

    Dynamic State: Changes color based on state (e.g., Red for Pomodoro Focus, Green for Break, Blue for Free Flow).

4. Metrics & Statistics

Data is calculated on-the-fly from the JSON logs.

    Daily Timeline: A visual "bar" or list showing when work happened throughout the day.

    Breakdown by Project: Pie/Bar chart showing which project took the most time.

    Productivity Efficiency: A ratio showing "Actual Work" vs. "Total Elapsed Time" (derived from the Honesty Check).

    Daily Break Counter: A simple integer count of how many breaks were taken today (does not store break "sessions," just a tally).

    History Log: A searchable list of all past sessions.

5. Data Architecture (JSON)

To ensure future cloud-syncing compatibility, the data is split into logic-based files.
File	Purpose	Key Data Points
projects.json	Project Metadata	uuid, name, notes, is_archived, color.
sessions.json	The Work History	uuid, project_id, type, start_time, end_time, actual_work_minutes, label.
daily_stats.json	Daily Aggregates	date, breaks_taken (counter).
settings.json	User Preferences	pomodoro_config, hud_enabled, theme_preference.
Constraints (What this app is NOT)

    NOT a Task Manager (no to-do lists within projects).

    NOT a Calendar (no scheduling).

    NOT a Team Tool (single-user focus).
